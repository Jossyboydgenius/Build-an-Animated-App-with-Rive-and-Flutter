Welcome to my Flutter series focused on animations. In this series, we will build an app featuring:

- A beautiful background animation using shapes and blur.
- A cool button animation.
- A loading animation when the sign-in button is tapped.
- An error animation if there is an issue.
- A success animation with confetti if everything is okay.
- Animated icons on the bottom navigation bar to enhance the app design.

What's unique about this series is that we will use animated assets created in Rive, a powerful animation tool. These animations are not coded but designed in Rive, making it easier to create stunning animations for your website, iOS, Android, and especially Flutter apps.
